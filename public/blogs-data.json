    "question": "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components? Which one is better?",
    "answer": "Controlled components are those where form data is handled by React state, while uncontrolled components store their own state internally using refs. Controlled components are generally preferred because they enable immediate validation and more predictable behavior, though uncontrolled components can be better for performance with large forms.",
